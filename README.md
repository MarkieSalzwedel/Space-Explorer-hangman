## Space Explorer Hangman Game!
Space Explorer is a Java-based GUI application based off of the popular children's game Hangman. Just like Hangman, the player will be only given empty spaces representing each letter of the word. The user is able to enter a single letter/character as a guess, or enter an entire word as a guess. 

Instead of the traditional illustration of a hanged man, a rocket is displayed along with stars. Both the rocket and the stars represents the player's lives. When the player enters a wrong guess, a star fades and the rocket loses a piece of itself.

Space Explorer was a project focusing on:
- Java GUI practice
